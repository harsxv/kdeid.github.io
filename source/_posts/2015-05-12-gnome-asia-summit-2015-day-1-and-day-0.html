<p>I attended <a href="http://2015.gnome.asia/" target="_blank">GNOME Asia Summit 2015</a> at University of Indonesia, Depok. Never planned to attend this event until <a href="https://tuanpembual.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Pak Tuan (Estu)</a> ask <a href="http://seketika.tumblr.com/" target="_blank">Siska</a> if I want to join as Local Committee, suddenly I replied "Yes, of course" :D . This is my first time I attended as a volunteer for Local Committee, usually I attended an event as a participant, or just enter the event without registering (I did this thing a lot).</p>
<p>I went to Depok at May 5 2015 at night, then arrived in the morning at University of Indonesia Commuter Station (Thanks to Hadi who take us from the station to guest house).</p>
<p>At the Day -1, we met with <a href="https://lleksah.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Julita</a>, a girl from Peru (imagine how long she take a flight to Indonesia) and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/akshaim" target="_blank">Akshai</a> from India, nothing much to do, just walking around Depok and did preparation meeting.</p>
<h3>Day 0 - Workshop Day</h3>
<p>Today is a workshop day, four session held at Fasilkom Universitas Indonesia (Faculty of Computer Science University of Indonesia) May 7 2015, at the day, I am in-charge for preparing speakers presentation, setting their laptop or their slides, even assist them to taking a video streaming :D</p>
<p>We have four session of workshop, first came from <a href="http://andika-lives-here.blogspot.com/" target="_blank">Andika Triwidada</a>, he talk about Translating GNOME to Bahasa Indonesia. It's interesting because of his team effort, we have GNOME in Bahasa Indonesia (Indonesian). He ask to us to contributing at translation, it still have much to be done to achieve 100% of translation.</p>

<p>If you interested to join the translation project, you can visit <a href="https://l10n.gnome.org/" target="_blank">l10n.gnome.org</a> (if you see "Damned Lies", you come to the right place), send a mail to <a href="mailto:gnome-l10n-id@googlegroups.com" target="_blank">gnome-l10n-id@googlegroups.com</a>, and <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/TranslationProject" target="_blank">Wiki of Translation Project</a>.</p>
<p>The next session is Akshai, he gave workshop about <a href="http://www.microhope.org/" target="_blank">MicroHOPE</a> and other device with -Garuda-Indonesia-Airlines-look-alike- logo printed on it. Damn, that MicroHOPE board can become anything, from a buzzer, flasher, or a clock.</p>

<p>Last session for Day 0 came from <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/kittykat/" target="_blank">Ekaterina Gerasimova</a> and <a href="http://www.alexandrefranke.com/" target="_blank">Alexandre Franke</a> (I thought they are a couple, but they are not :D ), they invite us to contribute to GNOME project, and at the end of presentation, they ask to us to join a short group discussion about translating, documenting and marketing. I want to join for testing, but they didn't have any, so I made a new group with <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/aklapper/" target="_blank">Andre Klapper</a>! We are a "testing" guys!</p>
