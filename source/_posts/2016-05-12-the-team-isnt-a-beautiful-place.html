<p>Once I was work alone, I dreamt having a team which can help me to find some solutions, I was though that team is an ideal place to work. Once I got a team at a new company which I joined with, I pulled my words. A team is a place like a hell, it driving me nuts when my teammates pushed me, I have to adapt with my team culture, adapt with their character and often debated for nothing.</p>
<p>Having a team isÂ hard, I can't stand on my ego as a dumb-perfectionist man, I can't do anything with the way that I like, it's like I stay in a prison.</p>
<p>Nope, actually, I am happy with my team, those story just a random thoughts that crossed in my mind today, :what if I got a wrong team?" I believe in my team, they are who develop me into a real fighter, they helped me a lot, they inspired me to do and explore more. The good thing having a team reducing my ego and my temper, I do often stressed by my team, but they also cheer me up to give us spirit.</p>
<p>If you feel you came to a wrong team, it maybe you just a wrong person for the team.</p>
