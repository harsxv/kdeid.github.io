<p>Yet another Stories Transmitted. The day 1, the day when the 'real' conference began. Here's the story.</p>
<h3>Day 1</h3>
<p>The conference began, it took place at Balairung University of Indonesia with welcoming speech from Ahmad Haris and Max Huang, they represent as GNOME and GNOME Asia Local Team. Actually, they given 30 minutes to talk but they just gave a short talk, less than 5 minutes each, this made a schedule changed a little bit and cause a coffee break time came longer than it should be :D (Pssst... Utian set this up, it his idea to make Coffee Break longer :p )</p>
<p>The day 1 opened by Dean of Faculty of Computer Science, Mrs. Mirna Adriani, Dra, B.Sc, PhD and she hit the gong as a symbol that the conference officialy started.</p>

<p>The next speech came from Mr. Aidil Chendramata Director of Information Security of Ministry of Communication and Telecommunication of Indonesia. He spoke about information security and benefit of Open Source Software, and also he said that Open Source Software is more secure and safe than Closed Source Software or Proprietary Software because we can take a look at the code, know everything the code is written and we can fix the code also if something wrong on the code. Couldn't agree more, Sir.</p>

<h3>Side Story</h3>
<p>When I was walking at Margonda street trying to find some food for Siska and Umul, I met with <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/aklapper/" target="_blank">Andre Klapper</a> and <a href="https://blogs.gnome.org/ovitters/" target="_blank">Olav Vitters</a> and they was looking for some food too, so we, Me and Hadi took them to Rumah Makan Padang, a local restaurant that serve local dishes from Padang. I ask them to try beef rendang with rice and give them a challenge, eat using hand!</p>
