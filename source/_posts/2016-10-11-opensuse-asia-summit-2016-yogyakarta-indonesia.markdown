openSUSE.Asia Summit 2016 is an annual summit which gather users, developers and people who are using, developing and involving in openSUSE Project across Asia. This post is a story of me as a local team, as a speaker, as a participant.

# Local Team Side

## The Preparation

I'm not sure when the preparation is begin, but I'm sure it started in about 2015 when [Estu](https://tuanpembual.wordpress.com/), [Edwin](http://medwinz.blogspot.co.id/), and [Utian](http://utian.azoebs.com/) went to openSUSE.Asia Summit 2015 in Taipei, Taiwan  they were propose to create 2016 summit in Yogyakarta, Indonesia to openSUSE Asia Board.

After they back to Indonesia, Estu call me and discuss about managing this event
Estu: "We will manage openSUSE Asia Summit 2016 here in Yogyakarta"
Me: "OK, so, what do I need to do?"
Estu: "We need people to manage it, we need a team to initialize this, but let's finish the event proposal first"

About May 2016, Estu started to develop the proposal for openSUSE Board, I helped the proposal team and added some information about flight route to and from Adisucipto International Airport, fixed typographical error and did proofreading before it sent to the board. It was a mixed feeling after submitted the proposal, because we just propose another event before and rejected, we didn't have plan B for this situation.

Done with event proposal, it's time to develop a team. First initialization meetup attended by me, Estu, [Siska](https://iskandarsiska.wordpress.com), Yuni, Agung, Nopal, Anisa, and some folks I can't remember. But in the middle of the journey, some people leave and left me, Estu, Siska as -core- Local Team. Agung and Anisa still in the team, but not as core team as the trio.

And then we did some radio visit, thank you Ibra for your help to promote us to local radio!

## The Event

As you may know, the event itself held at 1 to 2 October 2016 and pre-event workshop at 30 September 2016. The workshop is did well and we are satisfied with it. But at the end of the day, we found that one of our sponsor left their property at workshop lab and they are disappear. We asked to every-single-human-being in the room to take care of their property and be responsible to it.

### Day 1

First day of the event made me nervous, it was first day of the event, handling 450 people at a same time in a same place will not easy, but we did it anyway. As the result, registration desk is a mess, people can't queue and leave the desk in chaos, we are panic, but thanks to Info Desk team to took it under control.

Not much I can say about first day of the event, it was a successful first day, although we are a little disappointed with our performance, but everything run as smooth as silk.

Our first day closed by small chit-chat among Local Team and Volunteers, we talked about 'today evaluation' and pursue better performance for next day.

Ah, actually we have dinner with Local Team, Interlocal Team, Volunteers and Speakers at Bale Timoho Restaurant. This is a great experience and our sweat actually paid off that night :grin:. Thanks!

*Here, we are talking about Japanese culture with Kentaro Hatori, mostly we are talk about JAV, Hentai and any other 'weird' Japanese culture :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:*

## Day 2

The last day of summit, stamina already drained, Estu seen exhausted, we are lack of sleep, but we still have spirit to make this more success than first day.

Problem begin when one of our Keynote Speaker's Assistant ask for internet connection, I ask our Info Desk to talk with our sponsor which will provide internet connection for whole day including workshop and conference day, I tell him to ask what's the SSID and Password, and my team came with sad news because they didn't setup the internet since Day 1. So I gave our Keynote Speaker's Assistant my internet connection, tethered from my phone.

Honestly, I still mad at this single sponsor :triumph:.

At the end of the day, I watched the video from second day activities, and it made me cry, why? Because of our hard work, we successfully managed this event till the last day!

## Conclusion

So, I would say thank you for everyone to made this event happened in my life! For all sponsors, team, volunteers, openSUSE and SUSE board, participants, securities.

As our thank you to the volunteers, we chose one volunteer as best of the best, it's not means that other volunteers isn't good, they are the best team, without them, we will give up at the Day 1. Although our volunteers are not paid, they show great effort and great contributions to the event, they are youth and full of energy, they are priceless. So, we decided to chose Muhammad Haedar Zhafran Hidayatullah as the best volunteer! Congratulations for your new shoes! :joy:
