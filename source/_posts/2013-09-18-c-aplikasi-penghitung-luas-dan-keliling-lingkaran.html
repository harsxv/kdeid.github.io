<p>Tugas kuliah dishare disini ah (Akhirnya bisa kuliah juga :D ). Dapet tugas Mata Kuliah Algoritma dan Pemrograman, disuruh bikin aplikasi buat ngitung luas dan keliling lingkaran di C++. Bingung lah yang gak pernah nyentuh C++ akhirnya harus bersetubuh dengan bahasa ini, ubek-ubek referensi dari <a href="http://www.cplusplus.com/">http://www.cplusplus.com/</a> dan akhirnya dapet flowchart seperti ini:<br />

<p>Nah, terus code nya seperti ini:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint linenums lang-cpp">#include
using namespace std;

int main()
{
float l_lingk, k_lingk;
int r;
// Input radius value
cout << "Input your radius value.n";
cin >> r;
// r % 7 computes the remainder when r is divided by 7
if ( r % 7 == 0 )
// Calculate them!
l_lingk = 3.14*r*r; // luas
k_lingk = 3.14*2*r; // keliling
// Bring it on display
cout << "The area of circle is " << l_lingk << ".n";
cout << "The circumference of circle is " << k_lingk << ".n";
return 0;
}</pre>
<p>Kalau code diatas sudah selesai, save dengan nama apa saja dan ekstensi .cpp lalu compile dengan compiler apa aja lalu coba jalankan. Contoh:</p>
<pre class="prettyprint">
$ g++ lingkaran.cpp -o lingkaran
$ chmod +x lingkaran
$ ./lingkaran
</pre>
